Like most developers I’ve started many projects, and left almost as many unfinished. Looking back it’s easy to feel like none of my abandoned projects were any good–partly because when I look back it’s necessarily with more experience, but also because I often don’t have anything to look back on. I’m aiming to solve the latter by documenting projects I work on in my free time in this blog. Recently I’ve been working building a scripting language which I’ll eventually write some posts about, but I figured for my first post I’d take the easy way out and pulled together some old screenshots that I thought were worth showing off.

The first couple screenshots are from a deferred renderer I was working on about a year ago, and then put on hold when I started rewriting all my game dev libraries in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/){:target="_blank"} instead of C++.

	<figcaption>I know what you’re thinking–waay too much bloom. IIRC I was testing out an adaptive exposure shader, and took this screenshot right after turning away from a dark area.</figcaption>

	<img src="/assets/shadows-soft.png" />
	<figcaption>I was also super excited about <a href="http://developer.download.nvidia.com/shaderlibrary/docs/shadow_PCSS.pdf" target="_blank">percentage closer soft shadows</a>. You can’t tell in the picture, but I had the light set up to rotate around the scene which made watching the shadows stretch out and blur and such super fun.</figcaption>

	<figcaption>And of course, the obligatory overdone <a href="http://www.crytek.com/cryengine/cryengine3/downloads" target="_blank">sponza</a> SSAO test. Unfortunately I couldn’t find any screenshots of the actual renders of this scene.</figcaption>
</figure>

This next one isn’t a software project, but apparently I made a low poly model of a sick looking guitar, took a single screenshot of, and then never did anything with it. So, here it is:

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/Screen-shot-2011-11-19-at-4.37.45-PM-Nov-19-2011.png" width="250" />
	<figcaption>I kind of want this to be real now.</figcaption>
</figure>

These last few are from four or five years ago, back when I was in high school and hadn’t yet gotten into lower level programming. Unlike most of the other screenshots, the game depicted here was not built in my own engine but instead built in [dim3](http://klinksoftware.net/). All the artwork in these was my own.

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-04-18-at-3.34.37-PM.png" />
	<figcaption>This was a real nuanced game, in case that wasn’t evident from the UI.</figcaption>
</figure>

<figure>
	<img src="/assets/Screen-Shot-2015-04-18-at-3.34.15-PM.png" />
	<figcaption>Looking back this glass breaking effect was pretty bad, but I was really excited about it at the time to the point that smashing windows became an actual game mechanic.</figcaption>
</figure>

That’s all I was able to find that’s worth posting for now, though I might update this post if I find anything else cool laying around. :)
