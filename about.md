Hey! I’m a programmer/game developer currently living in Santa Cruz, California. I’m excited about games, game engines, compilers, and pretty much everything else.

I'm currently leading a small team building [Way of Rhea](https://www.anthropicstudios.com/way-of-rhea){:target="_blank"}, a side scrolling puzzle game built on top of my game engine and scripting language. I'm also available for freelance work.

I previously worked on Windows 10 at Microsoft, internal tools at Google, and was Tech Lead for the SDK/Apps teams at [CTRL-Labs](ctrl-labs.com) where they're [building a neural interface](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/){:target="_blank"}. If you want more of that sort of thing, you can [visit my LinkedIn...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masonremaley/){:target="_blank"}

If you want to get in touch for any reason, feel free to [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masonremaley){:target="_blank"} or send me an email at [{{ site.email }}](mailto:{{ site.email }}).
