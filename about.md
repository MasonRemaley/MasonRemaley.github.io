Hey! I’m a programmer/game developer currently living in Manhattan. I’m excited about games, game engines, compilers, and pretty much everything else.

The projects I post about on this blog are all things I do in my spare time, during the day I’m currently [working at CTRL-Labs building a brain machine interface](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/){:target="_blank"} and some games that can be played with it. I previously worked on Windows 10 at Microsoft, on some internal tools at Google, and on tech for a couple of studies at a neuroscience lab at The University of Maryland. I don’t currently have a resume online, but if you’re looking for more of that sort of thing you can [visit my LinkedIn...](https://www.linkedin.com/in/masonremaley/){:target="_blank"}

If you want to get in touch for any reason, feel free to [message me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masonremaley){:target="_blank"} or send me an email. My email address is just my full name at gmail, I’m not gonna put it inline here as I don’t want the spam bots to find it and I don’t feel like looking up what the current js snippet people use to trip them up is ATM. :)
