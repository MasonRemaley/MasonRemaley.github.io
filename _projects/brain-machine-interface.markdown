During the day, I'm working on a brain machine interface at [CTRL-Labs](https://ctrl-labs.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/){:target="_blank"} and [National Geographic](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/chasing-genius-ctrl-labs-brain-machine-interface/){:target="_blank"} already have good write ups explaining what it is so I'm not gonna duplicate that content here.

Most of my work at CTRL-Labs revolves around building tools that game developers will be able to use to interface with the device, and building games with the device myself to figure out what it's good at and what needs work. We're a start up though, so at the end of the day I end up doing a little bit of everything from modifying how how we interpret the EMG data to building tools for internal use.
