I worked on [CTRL-labs'](https://ctrl-labs.com/){:target="_blank"} neural interface from 2017-2019, [Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/brain-machine-interface-isnt-sci-fi-anymore/){:target="_blank"} and [National Geographic](https://news.nationalgeographic.com/2018/02/chasing-genius-ctrl-labs-brain-machine-interface/){:target="_blank"} already have good write ups on the project so I'm not gonna duplicate that content here.

As Tech Lead of the Apps/SDK teams, my work primarily revolved around making the device accessible to game developers--primarily through a Unity SK that I built--and then testing it out by building demo games. That being said, there were only around ~20 people when I originally joined, so I ended up doing a little bit of everything from modifying how how EMG data was interpreted to building miscellaneous internal tools.
