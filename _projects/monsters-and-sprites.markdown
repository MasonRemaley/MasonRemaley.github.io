_Monsters and Sprites_ is a narrative puzzle game being built in [my engine](/projects/game-engine).

The original prototype pictured below was built in nine days for a [Playcrafting](https://playcrafting.com/) expo. [Here's the original devlog on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masonremaley/status/988634973245669377).

If you've tried out the demo at an expo or just like the video and want to see this turn into a full length game, [@ me on twitter](https://twitter.com/masonremaley) or [shoot me an email](mailto:mason.remaley+pub@gmail.com). We're all working on a lot of projects simultaneously, knowing when there's interest helps us decide what to prioritize!

My Twitter is currently the primary means of communication for updates on the game.
