_Monsters and Sprites_ is a small puzzle game I'm working on with [Carolyn Whitmeyer](https://www.facebook.com/NyloracArt/){:target="_blank"} in [my engine](/projects/game-engine/). You play as a lost sprite trying to meet up with their friends on the other side of the woods, but a number of colorful obstacles block your path. We're currently building a ~7 day prototype of the game that we'll use to decide whether to pursue the idea further. Watch this page or [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/masonremaley) for updates. :)
